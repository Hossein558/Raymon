--To resolve the error related to the READ_COMMITTED_SNAPSHOT isolation level in SQL Server, you need to enable the READ_COMMITTED_SNAPSHOT option for the Jira database. This isolation level is required by Jira to function correctly.
--Here are the steps to enable READ_COMMITTED_SNAPSHOT for your jira database:
--Run the following SQL query: Open a query window in SSMS and run the following query to check the current status of READ_COMMITTED_SNAPSHOT for the jira database:

USE master;
GO
SELECT name, is_read_committed_snapshot_on 
FROM sys.databases 
WHERE name = 'jira';
--This will show if READ_COMMITTED_SNAPSHOT is ON or OFF.
--Enable READ_COMMITTED_SNAPSHOT: To enable it, you can run this command:
ALTER DATABASE jira 
SET READ_COMMITTED_SNAPSHOT ON;
--Verify the change: After running the ALTER DATABASE command, you can re-run the query from Step 2 to confirm that the setting is now ON.
USE master;
GO
SELECT name, is_read_committed_snapshot_on 
FROM sys.databases 
WHERE name = 'jira';
